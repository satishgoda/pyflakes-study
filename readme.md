# pyflakes-study
A copy (not a fork) of pyflakes for "offline" study and experimentation.

To paraphrase Richard Feynman, that which I cannot alter I do not understand, and can not explain.

Pyflakes is a work of genius, and pyflakes is a fundamentally important tool.
Pyflakes is about 60 times faster than pylint, which means pyflakes can be used in ways that pylint cannot.

The intention of this project is to understand and explain every significant design and coding choice embodied in the code,
so that people can understand how and why the code works, and especially how it can check so much so quickly.
I'll also explore pyflakes's limitations and what it would take to remove them.
